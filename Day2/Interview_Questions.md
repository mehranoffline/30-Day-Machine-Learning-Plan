# Day 1: Interview Questions

## 1. What is Machine Learning?
- **Answer**: Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on that data.

## 2. Difference Between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
- **Supervised Learning**:
  - Uses labeled data.
  - Tasks include classification and regression.
  - Example: Predicting house prices based on features.
- **Unsupervised Learning**:
  - Uses unlabeled data.
  - Tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
  - Example: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.

## 3. How Does Machine Learning Differ from Traditional Programming?
- **Traditional Programming**:
  - Involves explicitly programming rules and logic to perform tasks.
  - Requires detailed instructions for every possible scenario.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - Involves training models on data to learn patterns and make predictions.
  - The model generalizes from the data without being explicitly programmed for specific tasks.

## 4. Real-World Applications of Machine Learning
- **Classification Tasks**:
  - Email spam detection.
  - Image recognition.
- **Regression Tasks**:
  - Predicting stock prices.
  - Estimating sales figures.
- **Clustering Tasks**:
  - Customer segmentation.
  - Document clustering in NLP.

## 5. What Is the General ML Pipeline?
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering data from various sources.
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and data transformation.
3. **Model Selection**: Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithm.
4. **Training**: Feeding data to the model to learn patterns.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
6. **Deployment & Maintenance**: Implementing the model in a production environment and ensuring it continues to perform well over time.
