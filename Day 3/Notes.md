Day 3: Machine Learning Progression

Summary of Day 1 and Day 2

Day 1: Basics of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning:

Definition: Learning from labeled data to predict outputs.

Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression.

Example: Predicting house prices.

Unsupervised Learning:

Definition: Learning from unlabeled data to find patterns or groupings.

Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA.

Example: Customer segmentation.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.

Scaling and normalization.

Encoding categorical data.

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Day 2: Advanced Concepts

Logistic Regression:

Used for binary classification (e.g., spam detection).

Predicts probabilities using the sigmoid function.

K-Means Clustering:

Groups data into K clusters based on feature similarity.

Applications include customer segmentation and image compression.

Overfitting and Underfitting:

Overfitting: Model performs too well on training data but poorly on new data.

Underfitting: Model is too simple to capture patterns in data.

Model Evaluation:

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

Cross-validation: Splitting data into multiple folds for robust evaluation.

Day 3: Feature Engineering and Decision Trees

Goals:

Review key concepts from previous days.

Understand feature engineering techniques.

Learn about Decision Trees for regression and classification.

1. Feature Engineering

What is Feature Engineering?

Definition: Transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve model performance.

Purpose: Extract useful information, reduce noise, and enhance model interpretability.

Key Techniques:

Creating New Features:

Combining existing features (e.g., BMI = weight/height^2).

Extracting information (e.g., extracting year from a date column).

Feature Scaling:

Normalization (range 0-1).

Standardization (mean = 0, std = 1).

One-Hot Encoding:

Converting categorical variables into binary columns.

Feature Selection:

Removing irrelevant or redundant features using correlation analysis or feature importance.
