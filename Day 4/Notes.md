Day 3: Machine Learning Progression

Summary of Day 1 and Day 2

Day 1: Basics of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning:

Definition: Learning from labeled data to predict outputs.

Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression.

Example: Predicting house prices.

Unsupervised Learning:

Definition: Learning from unlabeled data to find patterns or groupings.

Algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN, PCA.

Example: Customer segmentation.

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.

Scaling and normalization.

Encoding categorical data.

Splitting data into training and testing sets.

Day 2: Advanced Concepts

Logistic Regression:

Used for binary classification (e.g., spam detection).

Predicts probabilities using the sigmoid function.

K-Means Clustering:

Groups data into K clusters based on feature similarity.

Applications include customer segmentation and image compression.

Overfitting and Underfitting:

Overfitting: Model performs too well on training data but poorly on new data.

Underfitting: Model is too simple to capture patterns in data.

Model Evaluation:

Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.

Cross-validation: Splitting data into multiple folds for robust evaluation.

Day 3: Feature Engineering and Decision Trees

Goals:

Review key concepts from previous days.

Understand feature engineering techniques.

Learn about Decision Trees for regression and classification.

1. Feature Engineering

What is Feature Engineering?

Definition: Transforming raw data into meaningful features that improve model performance.

Purpose: Extract useful information, reduce noise, and enhance model interpretability.

Key Techniques:

Creating New Features:

Combining existing features (e.g., BMI = weight/height^2).

Extracting information (e.g., extracting year from a date column).

Feature Scaling:

Normalization (range 0-1).

Standardization (mean = 0, std = 1).

One-Hot Encoding:

Converting categorical variables into binary columns.

Feature Selection:

Removing irrelevant or redundant features using correlation analysis or feature importance.

2. Decision Trees

What is a Decision Tree?

Definition: A tree-like model used for decision-making and prediction.

Types:

Classification Tree: Predicts discrete outcomes (e.g., spam or not spam).

Regression Tree: Predicts continuous outcomes (e.g., house prices).

How It Works:

Splits data into subsets based on feature values.

Each split minimizes impurity (e.g., Gini index, entropy).

Continues until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., max depth).

Advantages:

Easy to interpret.

Handles both numerical and categorical data.

Disadvantages:

Prone to overfitting (can be mitigated using pruning or limiting depth).

Exercises for Day 3

Perform feature engineering on a dataset (e.g., extract year from a date column, scale numerical features).

Build a decision tree classifier to predict customer churn.

Visualize the decision tree using graphviz or similar tools.

Conclusion

Todayâ€™s focus was on feature engineering and decision trees. These concepts are crucial for improving model performance and interpretability.

In the next session, we will cover ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting.
